# Nomic on GitHub

Welcome! This is Nomic for Coders, by ndelangen.

This is in very early stages of development.

## What is nomic?

> Nomic is a game created in 1982 by [philosopher Peter Suber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Suber), the rules of which include mechanisms for changing those rules, usually beginning by way of democratic voting.
>
> The game demonstrates that in any system where rule changes are possible, a situation may arise in which the resulting laws are contradictory or insufficient to determine what is in fact legal.

## What is Nomic on GitHub?

Nomic on GitHub is a game of Nomic played using GitHub pull requests.

Players submit pull requests to change the rules & implementation of rules of the game, and the game advances by merging those pull requests.

## Limitations

There are technical limitations to what can be done with GitHub pull requests.

For example, it is not possible to review one own's PR.

There are [soft rules](./docs/SOFT_RULES.md), that are not enforceable by code. These can also be edited via pull requests.

## What can you expect?

It is hard to predict how a game of Nomic will evolve. It is a game of emergent complexity.

I'm particularly interested in if this will still hold true in the realm of software development:

> The game demonstrates that in any system where rule changes are possible, a situation may arise in which the resulting laws are contradictory or insufficient to determine what is in fact legal.
